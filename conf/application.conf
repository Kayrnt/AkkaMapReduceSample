# The secret key is used to secure cryptographics functions.

# Database configuration

# You can declare as many datasources as you want.
# By convention, the default datasource is named `default`

# In order to reduce lock contention and thus improve performance,
# each incoming connection request picks off a connection from a
# pool that has thread-affinity.
# The higher this number, the better your performance will be for the
# case when you have plenty of short-lived threads.
# Beyond a certain threshold, maintenance of these pools will start
# to have a negative effect on performance (and only for the case
# when connections on a partition start running out).
db.default.partitionCount=5

# The number of connections to create per partition. Setting this to
# 5 with 3 partitions means you will have 15 unique connections to the
# database. Note that BoneCP will not create all these connections in
# one go but rather start off with minConnectionsPerPartition and
# gradually increase connections as required.

# Logger
# ~~~~~
# You can also configure logback (http://logback.qos.ch/), by providing a logger.xml file in the conf directory .

# Root logger:
logger.root=ERROR

# Logger used by the framework:
logger.play=INFO

# Logger provided to your application:
logger.application=DEBUG
